# Sudoku Solver Application

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based interactive Sudoku solver application that allows users to input Sudoku puzzles and solve them algorithmically. The application provides a visual grid interface for puzzle input and includes predefined sample puzzles of varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Users can watch the solving process in real-time with adjustable animation speed, making it both a functional puzzle solver and an educational tool for understanding backtracking algorithms.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Frontend Framework**: Built using Streamlit, providing a web-based interface with reactive components and session state management. This choice enables rapid development of interactive data applications with minimal frontend code.

**State Management**: Utilizes Streamlit's session state to maintain puzzle data across user interactions, including:
- Current grid state for user input and solving
- Original grid state to preserve initial puzzle constraints
- Solving animation control flags and speed settings

**Data Structure**: Employs NumPy arrays for efficient grid representation and mathematical operations on the 9x9 Sudoku grid, leveraging NumPy's performance benefits for numerical computations.

**Algorithm Architecture**: Designed to implement backtracking algorithm for puzzle solving, with built-in animation capabilities to visualize the solving process step-by-step.

**User Interface Design**: Grid-based input system allowing manual puzzle entry, complemented by predefined puzzle samples for quick testing and demonstration purposes.

## External Dependencies

**Core Dependencies**:
- `streamlit`: Web application framework for building the interactive user interface
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library for efficient array operations and grid manipulation
- `time`: Built-in Python module for controlling animation timing during the solving process

**Runtime Environment**: Designed to run in web browsers through Streamlit's server architecture, requiring no additional database or external service integrations for core functionality.
